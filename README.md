Pandas script for text analysis of shorthand records of all the speeches in the Chamber of Deputies. Getting data for this text analysis was easy. All we had to do was copy&paste them into an Excel file. Every speaker has their own sheet. We did no change to those texts. Text is stripped and splitted, stop words excluded. 
This is a data prep for a Tableau word cloud.
